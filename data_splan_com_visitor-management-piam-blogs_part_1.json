This critical objective necessitates the implementation of robust measures. As a result, Splan Hospital Visitor Management Solution emerges as a transformative tool, playing a pivotal role in achieving this paramount goal. Splan goes beyond merely managing visitors. It offers a holistic approach, seamlessly integrating with existing hospital systems to create a unified and efficient security framework.\nVisitors to Patients: Establishing a Secure Environment with Splan\n1. **Security through Optimized Visitor Flow:** Hospitals face a constant challenge in managing the influx of visitors, particularly in critical care areas like the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) and the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). These specialized units demand heightened security measures to ensure the well-being and privacy of vulnerable patients. The Splan Visitor Management Solution tackles this challenge head\u0002on by implementing a system for regulating and optimizing the number of visitors allowed in these sensitive areas at any given time.\n2. **Security through Digital Badge Access Control:** Splan's digital badging system strengthens access control in restricted areas. Authorized personnel receive digital badges granting them entry while maintaining a visual identification system for heightened security. This eliminates the need for physical keys or cards, streamlining access control procedures and minimizing the risk of unauthorized entry.\n3. **Security through Limiting the Visitor Hours:** Splan streamlines the crucial aspect of patient care – managing visiting hours. The system enforces designated visiting times, preventing overcrowding and maintaining a secure environment. Additionally, Splan empowers hospitals and residential care facilities to limit the number of concurrent visitors per room, per day, or per week. This ensures a structured approach, minimizes disruptions, and allows staff to provide a well-balanced patient experience. Furthermore, Splan offers flexibility by allowing for modifications to these rules on a patient-by-patient basis.\n4. **Security with Real-Time Communication and Watchlists:** Splan's robust communication features play a vital role in maintaining a secure hospital environment. The system utilizes a watchlist function to identify individuals of concern. Upon registration, visitors are automatically checked against this list, which can be internal or integrated with external databases like criminal records and sexual offender registries. If a match is found, security personnel are immediately notified via SMS alerts, allowing for a swift response. This real-time communication is especially crucial during emergencies, as Splan can also communicate with individuals on the watchlist through SMS, facilitating a faster and more effective emergency response.\n5. **Security through VIP Lists, Recurring Visitors and Parking Management:** Splan caters to diverse visitor needs. For VIPs and patients requiring anonymity or heightened security, the system offers complete name removal or aliasing. This ensures patient privacy while maintaining control, as only authorized personnel can access the correct information. Additionally, Splan streamlines the registration process for recurring visitors, such as medical staff or volunteers. Once registered, these individuals experience faster check-in times, enhancing operational efficiency without compromising security measures. Furthermore, Splan extends its reach beyond the hospital walls by integrating with parking systems. This ensures a coordinated approach to parking allocation and access, adding an extra layer of convenience for both visitors and hospital staff.\n#### Integration with Hospital Management Systems through HL7 Connector:\nSplan fosters a seamless and efficient hospital environment through its integration with leading hospital management systems like EPIC and CERNER. This vital integration ensures smooth information flow between platforms, creating a unified approach to hospital management. Beyond simply managing visitors, Splan offers valuable insights into daily visitor traffic. The system diligently tracks foot traffic patterns, empowering hospitals to gain a deeper understanding of visitor flow. This valuable data can be leveraged for comprehensive security planning and strategic resource allocation, ultimately enhancing the overall efficiency and security of the hospital.\nIn conclusion, Splan's Visitor Management Solution emerges as a powerful partner for hospitals. By streamlining visitor flow, managing access, and integrating seamlessly with existing systems, Splan empowers hospitals to prioritize patient and staff safety within a secure and supportive environment.\n* * *","url":"https://splan.com/enhancing-hospital-security-with-splan","page_title":"Splan Uniquely Provides Next Generation Cloud Solutions for Visitor Management System,appointments,School Check-ins and Event Management in a smarter way.","text":"\n\t \n\t\n\t\n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t\n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t\n\t\n\t \t\n\t \n\t\n\t\n\t \t\n\t \n\t \t\n\t \t\n\tModules\n\t \tEnhancing Hospital Security: The Integral Role of Splan Visitor Management Solution\n\t\n\t \t\n\t\n\t\n\tBy Marketing Team\n\t\n\t\n\tApril, 20 2021\n\t\n\t\n\tWithin the intricate and delicate ecosystem of a hospital, safeguarding the well-being and security of both patients and staff is of the utmost importance.

It offers a holistic approach, seamlessly integrating with existing hospital systems to create a unified and efficient security framework.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tVisitors to Patients: Establishing a Secure Environment with Splan\n\t\n\tSecurity through Optimized Visitor Flow: Hospitals face a constant challenge in managing the influx of visitors, particularly in critical care areas like the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) and the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). These specialized units demand heightened security measures to ensure the well-being and privacy of vulnerable patients. The Splan Visitor Management Solution tackles this challenge head\u0002on by implementing a system for regulating and optimizing the number of visitors allowed in these sensitive areas at any given time.\n\tSecurity through Digital Badge Access Control: Splan's digital badging system strengthens access control in restricted areas. Authorized personnel receive digital badges granting them entry while maintaining a visual identification system for heightened security. This eliminates the need for physical keys or cards, streamlining access control procedures and minimizing the risk of unauthorized entry.\n\tSecurity through Limiting the Visitor Hours: Splan streamlines the crucial aspect of patient care – managing visiting hours. The system enforces designated visiting times, preventing overcrowding and maintaining a secure environment. Additionally, Splan empowers hospitals and residential care facilities to limit the number of concurrent visitors per room, per day, or per week. This ensures a structured approach, minimizes disruptions, and allows staff to provide a well-balanced patient experience. Furthermore, Splan offers flexibility by allowing for modifications to these rules on a patient-by-patient basis.\n\tSecurity with Real-Time Communication and Watchlists: Splan's robust communication features play a vital role in maintaining a secure hospital environment. The system utilizes a watchlist function to identify individuals of concern. Upon registration, visitors are automatically checked against this list, which can be internal or integrated with external databases like criminal records and sexual offender registries. If a match is found, security personnel are immediately notified via SMS alerts, allowing for a swift response. This real-time communication is especially crucial during emergencies, as Splan can also communicate with individuals on the watchlist through SMS, facilitating a faster and more effective emergency response.\n\tSecurity through VIP Lists, Recurring Visitors and Parking Management: Splan caters to diverse visitor needs. For VIPs and patients requiring anonymity or heightened security, the system offers complete name removal or aliasing. This ensures patient privacy while maintaining control, as only authorized personnel can access the correct information. Additionally, Splan streamlines the registration process for recurring visitors, such as medical staff or volunteers. Once registered, these individuals experience faster check-in times, enhancing operational efficiency without compromising security measures. Furthermore, Splan extends its reach beyond the hospital walls by integrating with parking systems. This ensures a coordinated approach to parking allocation and access, adding an extra layer of convenience for both visitors and hospital staff.\n\t\n\tIntegration with Hospital Management Systems through HL7 Connector:\n\tSplan fosters a seamless and efficient hospital environment through its integration with leading hospital management systems like EPIC and CERNER. This vital integration ensures smooth information flow between platforms, creating a unified approach to hospital management. Beyond simply managing visitors, Splan offers valuable insights into daily visitor traffic. The system diligently tracks foot traffic patterns, empowering hospitals to gain a deeper understanding of visitor flow. This valuable data can be leveraged for comprehensive security planning and strategic resource allocation, ultimately enhancing the overall efficiency and security of the hospital.\n\tIn conclusion, Splan's Visitor Management Solution emerges as a powerful partner for hospitals. By streamlining visitor flow, managing access, and integrating seamlessly with existing systems, Splan empowers hospitals to prioritize patient and staff safety within a secure and supportive environment.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n \n\t\n\t \n\t \n\t","page_title":"Splan Uniquely Provides Next Generation Cloud Solutions for Visitor Management System,appointments,School Check-ins and Event Management in a smarter way.","url":"https://splan.com/enhancing-hospital-security-with-splan.html","date_scraped_timestamp":1747756925903,"markdown":"[](https://splan.com/index.html)\nModules\n## Enhancing Hospital Security: The Integral Role of Splan Visitor Management Solution\n* By Marketing Team\n \n* April, 20 2021\n \nWithin the intricate and delicate ecosystem of a hospital, safeguarding the well-being and security of both patients and staff is of the utmost importance.

Furthermore, Splan offers flexibility by allowing for modifications to these rules on a patient-by-patient basis.\n4. **Security with Real-Time Communication and Watchlists:** Splan's robust communication features play a vital role in maintaining a secure hospital environment. The system utilizes a watchlist function to identify individuals of concern. Upon registration, visitors are automatically checked against this list, which can be internal or integrated with external databases like criminal records and sexual offender registries. If a match is found, security personnel are immediately notified via SMS alerts, allowing for a swift response. This real-time communication is especially crucial during emergencies, as Splan can also communicate with individuals on the watchlist through SMS, facilitating a faster and more effective emergency response.\n5. **Security through VIP Lists, Recurring Visitors and Parking Management:** Splan caters to diverse visitor needs. For VIPs and patients requiring anonymity or heightened security, the system offers complete name removal or aliasing. This ensures patient privacy while maintaining control, as only authorized personnel can access the correct information. Additionally, Splan streamlines the registration process for recurring visitors, such as medical staff or volunteers. Once registered, these individuals experience faster check-in times, enhancing operational efficiency without compromising security measures. Furthermore, Splan extends its reach beyond the hospital walls by integrating with parking systems. This ensures a coordinated approach to parking allocation and access, adding an extra layer of convenience for both visitors and hospital staff.\n#### Integration with Hospital Management Systems through HL7 Connector:\nSplan fosters a seamless and efficient hospital environment through its integration with leading hospital management systems like EPIC and CERNER. This vital integration ensures smooth information flow between platforms, creating a unified approach to hospital management. Beyond simply managing visitors, Splan offers valuable insights into daily visitor traffic. The system diligently tracks foot traffic patterns, empowering hospitals to gain a deeper understanding of visitor flow. This valuable data can be leveraged for comprehensive security planning and strategic resource allocation, ultimately enhancing the overall efficiency and security of the hospital.\nIn conclusion, Splan's Visitor Management Solution emerges as a powerful partner for hospitals. By streamlining visitor flow, managing access, and integrating seamlessly with existing systems, Splan empowers hospitals to prioritize patient and staff safety within a secure and supportive environment.\n* * *","host":"splan.com"},{"date_scraped_timestamp":1747757073545,"text":"\n\t \n\t\n\t\n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t\n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t\n\t\n\t \t\n\t \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t \n\t Back to Webinars page\n\t \n\t \n\t\n\t Desk Management (Hoteling) Made Simple\n\t We are excited to invite you to register for our free webinar taking place on Wednesday, April 27th at 10:00 AM PDT/ 1:00 PM EST on Desk Management (Hoteling) Made Simple.Date: April 27th at 10:00 AM PDT/1:00 PM EST \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t\n\tSplan’s Next Generation Desk Management (Hoteling) is designed to help employees reserve a workstation, or other physical asset in advance.

From real-time authorization to predictive analytics, discover how systems like Splan are reshaping security protocols with innovation and efficiency.\n\t1. Streamlining Access with Real-Time Authorization\n\tIn the realm of physical security, timing isn't just a luxury—it's a critical component that separates success from vulnerability. Advanced visitor management systems like Splan are revolutionizing this space by offering real-time authorization capabilities. Imagine a scenario: an unexpected guest arrives—by simply checking their credentials against pre-approved lists and live databases, Splan immediately grants or denies access. This streamlined approach minimizes bottlenecks at entry points, keeping foot traffic flowing smoothly without compromising on safety.\n\tBeyond convenience, real-time authorization empowers security managers to adapt swiftly to dynamic threats. With immediate updates to access permissions, one can respond to incidents with the agility of a cat on hot bricks—evicting potential risks before they can even purr.\t\n\t\n\t2. Pre-scheduled Visits for Robust Planning\n\tCoordination is the backbone of robust security operations. By leveraging advanced visitor management systems like Splan to schedule visits in advance, you're essentially drawing a map before embarking on a treasure hunt. No more surprises—every entrant is expected, documented, and verified. This pre-planning enables security personnel to prepare for the exact volume of visitors, ensuring adequate staff and resources are prepared.\n\tMoreover, embracing pre-scheduled visits means that security screening can start before a visitor has even stepped foot on the premises. It’s like solving a puzzle before it spills out of the box—an anticipatory move that keeps you two steps ahead of any mishaps.\n\t3. Customizable Screening Procedures\n\tNot all visitors pose the same level of risk, and recognizing this is key to efficient security management. Advanced systems like Splan offer configurable screening procedures where you can tailor security checks based on a variety of factors. Perhaps certain visitors require a deeper dive due to their destination within your facility, or maybe they're carrying items that need extra scrutiny.\n\tThis tailored approach not only enhances efficiency but also sends a clear message that security is not a cookie-cutter operation in your domain. It adapts like a chameleon to anything thrown its way—be that a VIP with sensitive meeting agendas or a delivery person laden with parcels.\n\t\n\t\n\t4. Utilizing Data Analytics for Predictive Security\n\tData might just be the most underappreciated superhero in security operations. Advanced visitor management systems, including Splan, bring data analytics into the security fold, allowing managers to identify patterns and predict peaks in visitor flow. Harnessing this predictive power could transform how you allocate resources, potentially defusing situations before they escalate.\n\tVisualize Imagine being able to forecast when you'll need extra hands-on deck because the system has spotted that Thursdays at 3 PM have been historically hectic. That’s the sort of insight that turns reactive strategies into proactive triumphs.\n\t5. Seamless Integration with Other Security Systems\n\tA well-oiled security machine is not a solitary sentinel—it's a networked force. Integrating your visitor management systems with other security systems creates an interconnected web of defense. Whether its integrating with WiFi systems or looking out through watchlists or sending notifications through emergency management systems, Splan acts as the conductor to your security orchestra.\n\tThe result?

Credential breaches are an epidemic: 80% of security incidents involve stolen credentials. Our integrated solution shields you from unauthorized access attempts, especially those targeting privileged accounts.\n\t2. Integration gap? We've got you covered. A staggering 77% of organizations struggle with siloed IAM and PIAM, leading to security vulnerabilities. Splan and SailPoint bridge this gap, creating a unified access policy that streamlines compliance and eliminates inconsistencies.\n\t3.

Our combined approach ensures proper access management, defusing this threat before it detonates.\n\t4. Auditing is a pain, but it doesn't have to be. Nearly two-thirds of organizations wrestle with separate audits and certifications for IAM and PIAM. Our integrated solution streamlines this process, saving you time, resources, and headaches.\n\t5. Hidden credentials are the enemy. 90% of organizations worry about unprotected credentials lurking in the shadows. Splan and SailPoint stand united, shining a light on these risks and providing an integrated solution to fortify your security posture.\n\tMore than just integration, we are your PIAM powerhouse: \n\tThink of Splan and SailPoint as your one-stop shop for PIAM. We seamlessly integrate physical access management within the IAM platform, delivering:\t\n\t1. Unified Access Nirvana: Manage identities effortlessly, streamline user experiences, and respond to security incidents with lightning speed.\n\t2.

Healthcare staff can effectively monitor visitor movement and access.\n\t\n\t\n\t4. Retail - Personalized Shopping Experiences\n\tRetail establishments are incorporating Splan’s Mobile Credentialing as well.

The advent of mobile credentialing has revolutionized the way organizations handle visitors, offering a seamless and secure alternative. This technology isn't limited to a single sector; it has wide-ranging benefits across various settings, including offices, schools, hospitals, and more. Check out how our Splan’s Mobile Credentialing helps various industries with their visitor management needs.\n\t1. Offices - Streamlined and Secure Visitor Check-In\n\tLet's begin with offices. Splan’s Mobile Credentialing allows hosts to send electronic invitations to their guests. These invitations contain digital credentials that can be easily downloaded to the visitor's smartphone. When the visitor arrives, all they need to do is present their mobile credential for entry. This eliminates the need for outdated paper visitor logs or physical badges, and it enhances both security and the visitor experience.\n\t\n\t2. Educational Institutions - Enhanced Security\n\tIn educational settings, schools and universities have embraced Splan’s Mobile Credentialing. They can issue temporary mobile credentials to guest speakers, parents, contractors, and other visitors. These digital passes grant them access to the campus, specific buildings, or rooms. This not only ensures that visitors are properly tracked but also maintains a high level of security\n\t\n\t3. Healthcare Facilities - Convenient and Controlled Access\n\tThe healthcare sector also benefits from Splan’s Mobile Credentialing. Hospitals and medical facilities use this technology to streamline visitor access. Patients' families and guests can receive digital credentials on their smartphones, allowing them to access specific areas while maintaining essential security measures. Healthcare staff can effectively monitor visitor movement and access.\n\t\n\t\n\t4. Retail - Personalized Shopping Experiences\n\tRetail establishments are incorporating Splan’s Mobile Credentialing as well. They provide QR codes or digital passes to guests for events, promotions, or exclusive sales. By doing this, they ensure that only authorized individuals can participate in special activities, creating a secure and personalized shopping experience.\n\t\n\t5. Residential Communities - Secure and Convenient Access\n\tResidential communities, including apartment buildings and gated neighbourhoods, find Splan’s Mobile Credentialing, invaluable. Hosts can send digital invitations to guests and contractors, granting them temporary access. This system improves security and provides residents with a more convenient and streamlined way to manage visitors.\n\t6. Hospitality - Elevating Guest Experiences\n\tThe hospitality sector, particularly hotels, has enthusiastically adopted Splan’s Mobile Credentialing. Guests receive their room keys on their smartphones, allowing them to check in without waiting at the front desk. This convenient and secure process significantly enhances the overall guest experience.\n\tIn conclusion, Splan’s Mobile Credentialing is a game changer. It improves security, reduces administrative burdens, and provides a more convenient and professional experience for both hosts and guests. This technology is undeniably an essential tool for modern visitor management, ushering us into a more efficient, secure, and visitor-friendly era.\n\tWhy don’t you sign up for a Demo with us to deep-dive into this contemporary technology that makes lives easier?\n\t\n\t","markdown":"Features\n## Modernizing Visitor Management with Splan Mobile Credentialing\n* By Splan Marketing Team\n \n* October 30, 2023\n \nIn today's fast-paced world, traditional visitor management systems are becoming obsolete.

The advent of mobile credentialing has revolutionized the way organizations handle visitors, offering a seamless and secure alternative. This technology isn't limited to a single sector; it has wide-ranging benefits across various settings, including offices, schools, hospitals, and more. Check out how our Splan’s Mobile Credentialing helps various industries with their visitor management needs.\n\t1. Offices - Streamlined and Secure Visitor Check-In\n\tLet's begin with offices. Splan’s Mobile Credentialing allows hosts to send electronic invitations to their guests. These invitations contain digital credentials that can be easily downloaded to the visitor's smartphone. When the visitor arrives, all they need to do is present their mobile credential for entry. This eliminates the need for outdated paper visitor logs or physical badges, and it enhances both security and the visitor experience.\n\t\n\t2. Educational Institutions - Enhanced Security\n\tIn educational settings, schools and universities have embraced Splan’s Mobile Credentialing. They can issue temporary mobile credentials to guest speakers, parents, contractors, and other visitors. These digital passes grant them access to the campus, specific buildings, or rooms. This not only ensures that visitors are properly tracked but also maintains a high level of security\n\t\n\t3. Healthcare Facilities - Convenient and Controlled Access\n\tThe healthcare sector also benefits from Splan’s Mobile Credentialing. Hospitals and medical facilities use this technology to streamline visitor access. Patients' families and guests can receive digital credentials on their smartphones, allowing them to access specific areas while maintaining essential security measures. Healthcare staff can effectively monitor visitor movement and access.\n\t\n\t\n\t4. Retail - Personalized Shopping Experiences\n\tRetail establishments are incorporating Splan’s Mobile Credentialing as well. They provide QR codes or digital passes to guests for events, promotions, or exclusive sales. By doing this, they ensure that only authorized individuals can participate in special activities, creating a secure and personalized shopping experience.\n\t\n\t5. Residential Communities - Secure and Convenient Access\n\tResidential communities, including apartment buildings and gated neighbourhoods, find Splan’s Mobile Credentialing, invaluable. Hosts can send digital invitations to guests and contractors, granting them temporary access. This system improves security and provides residents with a more convenient and streamlined way to manage visitors.\n\t6. Hospitality - Elevating Guest Experiences\n\tThe hospitality sector, particularly hotels, has enthusiastically adopted Splan’s Mobile Credentialing. Guests receive their room keys on their smartphones, allowing them to check in without waiting at the front desk. This convenient and secure process significantly enhances the overall guest experience.\n\tIn conclusion, Splan’s Mobile Credentialing is a game changer. It improves security, reduces administrative burdens, and provides a more convenient and professional experience for both hosts and guests. This technology is undeniably an essential tool for modern visitor management, ushering us into a more efficient, secure, and visitor-friendly era.\n\tWhy don’t you sign up for a Demo with us to deep-dive into this contemporary technology that makes lives easier?\n\t\n\t","host":"splan.com","page_title":"Splan Uniquely Provides Next Generation Cloud Solutions for Visitor Management System,appointments,School Check-ins and Event Management in a smarter way.","markdown":"Features\n## Modernizing Visitor Management with Splan Mobile Credentialing\n* By Splan Marketing Team\n \n* October 30, 2023\n \nIn today's fast-paced world, traditional visitor management systems are becoming obsolete.

Streamlining Access with Real-Time Authorization\n\tIn the realm of physical security, timing isn't just a luxury—it's a critical component that separates success from vulnerability. Advanced visitor management systems like Splan are revolutionizing this space by offering real-time authorization capabilities. Imagine a scenario: an unexpected guest arrives—by simply checking their credentials against pre-approved lists and live databases, Splan immediately grants or denies access. This streamlined approach minimizes bottlenecks at entry points, keeping foot traffic flowing smoothly without compromising on safety.\n\tBeyond convenience, real-time authorization empowers security managers to adapt swiftly to dynamic threats. With immediate updates to access permissions, one can respond to incidents with the agility of a cat on hot bricks—evicting potential risks before they can even purr.\t\n\t\n\t2. Pre-scheduled Visits for Robust Planning\n\tCoordination is the backbone of robust security operations. By leveraging advanced visitor management systems like Splan to schedule visits in advance, you're essentially drawing a map before embarking on a treasure hunt. No more surprises—every entrant is expected, documented, and verified. This pre-planning enables security personnel to prepare for the exact volume of visitors, ensuring adequate staff and resources are prepared.\n\tMoreover, embracing pre-scheduled visits means that security screening can start before a visitor has even stepped foot on the premises. It’s like solving a puzzle before it spills out of the box—an anticipatory move that keeps you two steps ahead of any mishaps.\n\t3. Customizable Screening Procedures\n\tNot all visitors pose the same level of risk, and recognizing this is key to efficient security management. Advanced systems like Splan offer configurable screening procedures where you can tailor security checks based on a variety of factors. Perhaps certain visitors require a deeper dive due to their destination within your facility, or maybe they're carrying items that need extra scrutiny.\n\tThis tailored approach not only enhances efficiency but also sends a clear message that security is not a cookie-cutter operation in your domain. It adapts like a chameleon to anything thrown its way—be that a VIP with sensitive meeting agendas or a delivery person laden with parcels.\n\t\n\t\n\t4. Utilizing Data Analytics for Predictive Security\n\tData might just be the most underappreciated superhero in security operations.

Situational awareness helps management teams decide when to take action if a situation arises and how to mitigate risk. With a main goal of reducing risk exposure by detecting and preventing emergency events from taking place; having access to the right information is crucial. Atruly secure organization has critical security data available to its security personnel in real-time, but in some organizations, this is not the case. There are many companies out there that still have not invested in a physical security solution that provides analytics and data for analysis. Therefore, security teams are faced with a myriad of challenges daily which includes:\n\t\n\tControlling Access After Hours\n\tNot every employee is given access to certain locations of a building at any time of day. An employee with malicious intentions might want to go into a room where classified files are kept. The access control system would prevent the individual from entering, however that’s as far as it would go. What about finding out and identifying who the individual is to prevent it from happening again? If an organization has the ability to identify the person through analytics, then the situation can be corrected quickly.\n\tTracking Occupancy\n\tToday’s security teams must be able to know who is on the premises and at what time. This information is not only important to have in real-time for mustering purposes, but also when it comes to adhering to COVID-19 safety guidelines. Tracking the employees in a particular location and duration in the area helps ensure social distancing. In the event of an emergency, an organization would also want to know who is at their workstation or who is already outside of the building and evacuated.\n\tTailgating (unauthorized entry)\n\tVisitors, vendors, and contractors may want to enter a building, but they are unaware that they either need proper documentation to enter or they need to be granted access by someone on the inside.

Situational awareness helps management teams decide when to take action if a situation arises and how to mitigate risk. With a main goal of reducing risk exposure by detecting and preventing emergency events from taking place; having access to the right information is crucial. Atruly secure organization has critical security data available to its security personnel in real-time, but in some organizations, this is not the case. There are many companies out there that still have not invested in a physical security solution that provides analytics and data for analysis. Therefore, security teams are faced with a myriad of challenges daily which includes:\n1. **Controlling Access After Hours**\nNot every employee is given access to certain locations of a building at any time of day. An employee with malicious intentions might want to go into a room where classified files are kept. The access control system would prevent the individual from entering, however that’s as far as it would go. What about finding out and identifying who the individual is to prevent it from happening again? If an organization has the ability to identify the person through analytics, then the situation can be corrected quickly.3. **Tracking Occupancy**\nToday’s security teams must be able to know who is on the premises and at what time. This information is not only important to have in real-time for mustering purposes, but also when it comes to adhering to COVID-19 safety guidelines. Tracking the employees in a particular location and duration in the area helps ensure social distancing. In the event of an emergency, an organization would also want to know who is at their workstation or who is already outside of the building and evacuated.5. **Tailgating (unauthorized entry)**\nVisitors, vendors, and contractors may want to enter a building, but they are unaware that they either need proper documentation to enter or they need to be granted access by someone on the inside. Tailgating could be caused by someone as simply as holding the door open for a visitor without a badge. A worst-case scenario of a fraudulent visitor on premises could include anything ranging from theft of equipment to unauthorized access to the company’s intranet to physical harm, or access to intellectual ranging from theft of property.7. **Inactive Personnel**\nDeactivating badges is crucial for the safety of an organization. For example, if a recently fired disgruntled employee has not been removed from the granted database and can still roam the halls of their previous work building, they are an immediate threat. The ex-employee may know which rooms hold the extremely valuable assets that could damage an organization’s reputation if leaked to the public.9. **Lack of Communication**\nForgetting to notify a team member of a threat or not having a solid process in place leaves the door open for more threats to arise. Aligning processes and technology instantly prepares a security team to unprecedented challenges and issues. \n**Why are analytics important?** \nSecurity Insights serves as an analytic platform, providing analytical tools to security officers.

One crucial aspect of this security infrastructure is the seamless integration of a Visitor Management System (VMS) with Access Control Systems (ACS). This strategic alliance not only enhances the overall security posture but also brings about operational efficiencies.\n**Monitoring and Managing Visitor Acccess**\nFirst and foremost, connecting a VMS with ACS provides a comprehensive solution for monitoring and managing visitor access. By automating the registration process, the VMS streamlines visitor check-ins, capturing essential information and generating visitor badges with relevant access permissions. This ensures that only authorized individuals gain entry to specific areas, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential security breaches.\n**Real-time tracking of Visitors**\nAdditionally, the integration facilitates real-time tracking of visitors within the campus. ACS can leverage the data collected by the VMS to monitor and control access in various zones, allowing organizations to uphold strict security protocols. In the event of an emergency or security incident, quick and accurate information about visitor whereabouts becomes invaluable for effective response and resolution.\n**Improving Operational Efficiency**\nFurthermore, the synergy between VMS and ACS contributes to operational efficiency. The seamless flow of data between the systems minimizes manual interventions, reducing the likelihood of errors and saving valuable time for both security personnel and visitors. Automated access permissions also enhance the overall visitor experience by ensuring swift and hassle-free entry, fostering positive impressions of the organization.\n**Aiding Compliance Management**\nBeyond security and efficiency, this integration aids in compliance management. Many industries, such as healthcare and finance, have stringent regulatory requirements concerning visitor access and data privacy. The combined capabilities of VMS and ACS enable organizations to maintain compliance by accurately documenting and managing visitor information while adhering to industry standards.\nTo conclude, the integration of Visitor Management Systems with Access Control Systems represents a proactive approach to modern security challenges. By combining these technologies, organizations can fortify their defenses against unauthorized access, enhance operational efficiency, and demonstrate commitment to regulatory compliance.
